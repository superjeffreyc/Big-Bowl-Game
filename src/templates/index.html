        <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Divide the players into two equal groups. (4+ people recommended. To play with 2 or 3 people, just ignore the team scores and have fun.).</li>
          <li>Then, individually submit words to the word bank. Do not share words with your team or opponents! (Recommendation is 5 words per player).</li>
          <li>Once the game starts, take turns to try to get your team members to guess the current word on the screen. The opposite team cannot guess the word. However, they should listen so they know what words have been used so far.</li>
          <li>Your team has 1 minute to guess as many words as possible before the timer runs out.</li>
          <li>Continue switching teams until the word bank is empty. Once the word bank is empty, the game moves on to the next round using the same words.</li>
          <li>The team with the most points after the three rounds wins!</li>

        </ul>

        <br>
        <h2>THE THREE ROUNDS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b><u>ROUND 1: TABOO.</u></b> Use any phrases or sentences to describe the word on the screen (except the word itself).</li>
          <li><b><u>ROUND 2: CHARADES.</u></b> Use any gestures or motions to describe the word on the screen (no talking!).</li>
          <li><b><u>ROUND 3: PASSWORD.</u></b> You can only say ONE word to describe the word on the screen (except the word itself).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THIS APP</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new game.</li>
          <li>Optionally, you can have other people join your room and enter words. However, you can take turns using this device to input words.</li>
          <li>Once you are satisfied with the size of the word bank, click Start Game.</li>
          <li>Now, your device will be the only one used for the remainder of the game.</li>
          <li>Follow the instructions on the screen and begin playing the first turn!</li>
          <li>When your turn is complete, pass this device to the opposite team.</li>
        </ul>
